1. Swing Components
1.1 AWTAccumulator:

The AWTAccumulator uses AWT components like Frame, Label, and TextField. It calculates a running sum of user input values. Event-handling is implemented using a named inner class with the ActionListener interface.
1.2 SwingAccumulator:

The SwingAccumulator uses Swing components like JFrame, JLabel, and JTextField. The difference is that Swing uses lightweight components added to the content pane, making it more flexible.
1.3 Comparison:

Top-level containers: AWT uses Frame, Swing uses JFrame.
Component classes: AWT uses heavyweight classes (e.g., Label), while Swing uses lightweight alternatives (e.g., JLabel).
Look and Feel: Swing supports a pluggable look and feel, whereas AWT depends on the native OS.
2. Organizing Swing Components with Layout Managers
NumberGrid: A NumberGrid is created using a JPanel with a grid layout for buttons (0-9, DEL, C). The event-handling modifies a JTextField display.
3. Create GUI for AIMS Project
3.1 View Store Screen:

The View Store screen uses BorderLayout. The NORTH component contains a menu bar and header. The CENTER component is a grid of MediaStore panels.
3.2 Event-Handling:
Play Button: Displays a dialog to play media.
Add to Cart Button: Adds the media to the cart.
4. JavaFX API
4.1 Painter Application:

The application uses a Pane to draw with the mouse. Buttons are added for clearing and erasing. Event-handling is implemented in PainterController.
5. View Cart Screen (JavaFX)
FXML Design: A BorderPane is used. VBox contains the menu bar and cart label in the TOP. The CENTER contains a TableView for media items with columns for title, category, and cost.
Interactivity: Buttons in the RIGHT allow "Place Order," and selected media can be "Played" or "Removed."
6. Integrating JavaFX into Swing
The CartScreen class embeds a JavaFX Scene in a JFrame using JFXPanel. This enables integration of JavaFX UI into the existing Swing application.
7. Exception Handling
7.1 PlayerException:

The PlayerException is thrown when a mediaâ€™s length is <= 0. This is implemented in the play() methods of DigitalVideoDisc and CompactDisc.
7.2 Handling Exceptions:

Use try-catch blocks in the Aims class and display meaningful error messages in dialogs for user feedback.
8. Modify equals() Method in Media
Two Media objects are equal if they have the same title. Implement checks for NullPointerException and ClassCastException.
9. Update Diagrams
Update the use-case diagram and class diagram to include GUI features and an exception hierarchy tree for PlayerException and related exceptions.
